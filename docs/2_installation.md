# Download & Installation

## CSGO Server & Requirements
- [CSGO Server](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers)
- [Metamod](http://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php)
- [Sourcemod](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php)
- [Get5](https://github.com/splewis/get5)
- [Get5 Event API](https://github.com/yannickgloster/get5_eventapi)

#### Linux
On Linux I would recommend using [LGSM(Linux Game Server Managers)](https://linuxgsm.com/) to facilitate setting up the server:
https://linuxgsm.com/lgsm/csgoserver/.

Once you have your server setup with LGSM, you can run `./csgoserver mi` and select `Metamod` and then you can run `./csgoserver mi` and select `Sourcemod`.

#### Windows & MacOS & Linux
Follow the instructions here to get your server setup:
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers

Once the server is setup, install the latest version of [Metamod](http://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php) and [Sourcemod](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php) on the server:
http://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php

http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php

#### [Get5](https://github.com/splewis/get5)
The Discord bot requires the latest release of [Get5](https://github.com/splewis/get5) to be installed.
Download the [latest release](http://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/lastSuccessfulBuild/). 
Extract the download archive into the `csgo/` directory on the server.
Once the plugin first loads on the server, you can edit general get5 cvars in the autogenerated `cfg/sourcemod/get5.cfg`.
All the CVARS can be found on the [Get5 Github](https://github.com/splewis/get5/wiki/Full-list-of-get5-cvars).

I would recommend changing the following CVARs:
```
get5_kick_when_no_match_loaded "0"
```

A full installation guide and documentation on the [Get5 Github](https://github.com/splewis/get5#download-and-installation).

#### [Get5 Event API](https://github.com/yannickgloster/get5_eventapi)
Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/yannickgloster/get5_eventapi/releases) of the Github and download the latest `get5_eventapi.smx`.
Copy that file to `csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins` on your CSGO Server.

## Discord Bot Setup
1) Connecting the Bot to your Server
    1) Head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in with your Discord account
        
        ![New Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannickgloster/discord-10man/docs/docs/img/new_application.png)
        
    2) Name it `Discord 10man` and click create
        - You can add an icon afterward and a description to personalize the bot
    3) On the menu on the left hand side, select `bot`
        
        ![Select Bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannickgloster/discord-10man/docs/docs/img/select_bot.png)

        ![Add Bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannickgloster/discord-10man/docs/docs/img/add_bot.png)
        
    5) Under `token`, click on `copy`.
       This is your secret discord bot token, save it somewhere because we will need it for the `config.json` file.
       *Don't give this to anyone else because then they can take control of your bot.*
       
       ![Discord Token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannickgloster/discord-10man/docs/docs/img/token.png)

    13) Paste the link into a new tab in your browser
    14) Select the server you want to add it to!
    15) Now the bot is connected to the server, lets get the bot up and running!
2) Install Python & Python Requirements
    1) Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    2) Check that python installed correctly by opening a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows), and running the command `python --version`
        - It should return `Python 3.8.3` (or a greater version number)
    3) Install [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) by following these [instructions](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv):
        - [https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv)
    4) Verify that Pipenv is installed by opening a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and running `pipenv --version`
        - It should return `pipenv, version 2020.8.13` (or a greater version number)
3) Setting Up & Running the Bot
    1) Download the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/yannickgloster/discord-10man/releases) or download the latest development build by click on `code` on the github homepage and then clicking on `Download ZIP` 
    2) Unzip the files
    3) Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json`
    4) Open the file and edit the information:
        - Replace the `discord_token` with the token we got from your bot in Section 1) subsection v.
        - Fill in `bot_IP` with the public IP of the bot, more info on that later on
        - Leave `bot_port` with default value of 3000, unless you want to portforward and use a different port
        - Get a Steam Web API Key from here
            - [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
        - Fill in your server information
        - If you have multiple servers, the json file might look something like this:
        
        ```json
        {
            "discord_token": "123fkdjsh123alksjfhlaskdjafhlkj1hl3kj4hlkjss",
            "bot_IP": "321.321.321.321",
            "bot_port": "3000",
            "steam_web_API_key": "123ABDKLK12938712938SBDDS1723987",
            "servers": [
                {
                    "server_address": "csgo.yannickgloster.com",
                    "server_port": 27015,
                    "server_password": "pasword1234",
                    "RCON_password": "1234password"
                },
                {
                    "server_address": "123.123.123.123",
                    "server_port": 27015,
                    "server_password": "pasword1234",
                    "RCON_password": "1234password"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    5) Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and go to the folder where the bot is
    6) Install the requirements by running `pipenv install`
    7) Run the bot by running `pipenv run python3 run.py`
    8) Go into the discord and send `.about` into a text channel
        - It should return an embed with the version number
        - Alternatively, run the command `.connect` and it should display an embed with the information on the server. If this doesn't work, the `config.json` file was not configured properly.
    9) To run the bot permanently, you can use [`tmux`](https://www.howtogeek.com/671422/how-to-use-tmux-on-linux-and-why-its-better-than-screen/) on Linux.
        - Example `tmux` command
            - `tmux new-session -d -s discord 'pipenv run python3 run.py'`
            - This creates a new session called Discord
        - There are other cheap hosting alternatives if you don't want to run your PC permanently or don't have a server. The DiscordPY community recommends the following:
        
        ```

        Self-hosting:       Free hosting:                 Kinda free:
        Any computer.    No. Not even heroku.   GCP, AWS have one year free micros.
       ```
    10) If you are self hosting, on a different service, or not on the same server as the csgo server, you will have to portforward `port 3000` (or whatever port you set in the `config.json`)
        - If you google the following, you will find a tutorial on how to do so:
        > How do I portforward [INSERT ROUTER NAME/SERVICE NAME]
        - If you portfoward, you will need to edit `config.json`. Open it in a text editor
        - For `bot_IP` put in your public IP
